		<h3>Welcome to Sean's photofoli page.</h3>
		<p>This page is built in php with CodeIgniter Version <?=CI_VERSION?> to demonstrate my skill set as Full-stack developer.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Server Hosting : </h3>
				<p>This page is not hosted by typical web hosting service such as godaddy.com, bluehost.com, etc. but hosted by Sean's server in his home.
				</br>Therefore, this page is working only while his server (home computer) and ISP (Xfinity) are on.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Source Control, GIT : </h3>
				<p>All codes are on my own GIT repository.
				</br>In other words, I created an empty repository in my local computer just for my own source control.</p>
				<code>TODO : GITK Screen shot</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Web Development, Front End (Client Side) : </h3>
				<code><a href='<?=base_url()?>responsive_web_design'>Responsive Web Design</a></code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Web Development, Back End (Server Side): </h3>
				<code><a href='<?=base_url()?>user_access_control'>User Access Control (SignIn, SignUp, AJAX, etc.)</a></code>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>*Note : Most CSS and Front-end code in this photofolio are written by myself to demonstrate that I know those tricks, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to use other front-end framework, library, or plug-in.</p>
